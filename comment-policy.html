		Welcome to Rust Examples, a website and community focused on the Rust programming language.
	</p>
	<p>
		We try our best to make sure that the discussions on our articles are troll, spam and abuse free but we’re not omnipresent. The comment section can be a great place for interaction with readers, writers and even for spawning stimulating conversation – it can be a great place for all of us! To ensure that you have a good time over here at Rust Examples, please make sure to stick to the following guidelines:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Be polite</b> – don’t be rude to anyone and respect others. If something you say would get you in trouble offline, please don’t say it here. Remember there is a person behind the screen and that your words affect people.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Don’t troll.</b> We appreciate and welcome criticism towards writers here, but comments that add no value to the discussion or that are merely insulting would be deleted without exception.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Spam? Goodbye.</b> We understand that you can boost our SEO tenfold with this one trick, however, we are not interested. Please refrain from posting or we’ll give you a hand and show both you and your post the door.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		To put it in a simple sentence, the guidelines boil down to “Be nice”. Follow these guidelines or our moderators will remove your comment and we may also ban you from participating in the discussions.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you find any comments which violate our guidelines, please make sure to ‘flag’ or ‘mark as spam’ – our moderators highly appreciate your support!
	</p>
	<p>
		Happy commenting!
