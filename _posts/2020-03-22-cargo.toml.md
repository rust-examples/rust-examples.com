The best source for this is the [Cargo.toml reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html) documentation.

## Package section
This section describes your local Cargo Package.

Filename Cargo.toml:
```toml
[package]
name = "myapps"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Author Name <auther@email.com>"]
edition = "2018"
```

## Dependencies section
This section describes external packages with version numbers that the application is going to import.

Filename Cargo.toml:
```toml
[dependencies]
time = "0.1.12"
regex = "0.1.41"
```

## Badges section
[crates.io](https://crates.io/) can display various badges for build status, test coverage, etc. for each crate.
All badges are optional.

It's worth checking out the maintenance status of crates that you want to add to your code.

Filename Cargo.toml:
```toml
codecov = { repository = "..."}
maintenance = { status = "passively-maintained" }
```

## Other sections and more details
The [Cargo.toml reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html) documentation is pretty good,
go check that out.
