Prepare a new folder with minimal source code:
```bash
cargo new myapp
cd myapp
```
This creates a `myapp` package and a `myapp` crate.
It also creates a `src/main.rs` file, an entry point for a binary crate.

This package will be used in all module-related examples.

You can download the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/rust-examples/).
